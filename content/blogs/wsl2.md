title: "WSL2: WSL but better"
draft: false

the new WSL(Windows Subsystem Linux) is a nice tool for developers to test and develop projects on a simulated Linux kernel on Windows without running a full VM.
Doing so has many advantages such as requiring less computing power, better file access, etc.


However, it is not perfect. You might run into weird environment issues because it is not a full Linux distro after all.
For example, 32bit applications cannot run in WSL1, as well as many other limitations.


The WSL2 that Microsoft released can be a game-changer for this.
It is a much better simulator(though still not a VM), which practically allows you to do whatever you would do in a normal Linux installation.


But it is not perfect. From my experiences, I still run into weird permission issues.
In conclusion, it is a nice feature, but there are still problems with it. In the future, it can definitely be a nice tool for Windows users that require Linux environments.
