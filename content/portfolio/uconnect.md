## About the Job

“Bridging the gap between resource disadvantage and capability to inform future changemakers about the perfect school for them.”


Founded by grade 11 student Alfred Shi and other members, UConnect is an organization that informs students about post-secondary education and offers options to fit schools. We at UConnect recognize the privilege that came with private education–and the consequent gap between resource disadvantage and capability for other students across the world. Our aim is to give those students who deserve a better chance at higher education an understanding the right university for them and where their capabilities should land them.
