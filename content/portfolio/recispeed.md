## Recispeed
Our team is always frustrated when a crucial ingredient is missing while going through recipe books. This is why we developed this reverse search recipe app. In this app, you input everything you have, and it will return a list of recipes you can follow. This app is developed with React and ChakraUI, and dockerized and deployed on hop.io. Hop really made my life a lot easier, because it simplified all the complicated deployment and scales automatically. We will definitely use Hop in our future projects.


As a side note, because the database we currently have are very small, and a lot of the time it will just return an empty list. To fix this problem, for now, the app might still return a few recipes that contain unselected ingredients. We aim to continue increasing the size of the database and eventually achieve 100% matching results.
