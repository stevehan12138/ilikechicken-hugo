You just found my website! Allow me to give you a tour.


This is my extremely minimalistic static site hosted on github.io.
Countless of new Javascript frameworks are being made everyday, but they are all designed for extremely large traffic, and it doesn't make sense to use them on a personal blog site.
That's why I chose the opposite for my website.
I chose Hugo for static site generation, Bootstrap and SCSS for styling(vanilla CSS is pure pain), and a little bit of vanilla JS or petite-vue for some reactivity and animations.
I also plan to use Firebase or other similar alternatives to store data in case I need it later on to store comments and stuff.
The site is also automatically deployed through Github Actions.


Text me up if you like my work! I'm always free to talk(mostly). You can find me through my Email and Discord.
