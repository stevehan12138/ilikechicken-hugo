title: "Git Logging Github Accounts With 2FA"
draft: false
---

if you have 2FA for your Github account activated, it will be annoying to access your private repositories through git, since your password wouldn't work anymore.


What you want to do is that to make a token specifically for whatever you are doing. 
Go to settings -> developer settings -> tokens and generate the token. With the token, you can now login in through git. 
Make sure to save the token somewhere if you want to use it again as it won't appear on the website again and you can only generate a new token.
