## About Me

I'm a high schooler living in Toronto who is highly interested in CS. I liked to tinker with computers when I was really young and kept the interest until now. I'm looking for any CS-related volunteer or intern opportunities, as well as learning more about the field and the future of technology. If you have any questions or want to get in touch, please feel free to contact me.


My personal vision in the field of computers is to pursue higher education and eventually become a software engineer. I enjoy learning new concepts and putting them to use, as well as learning new languages and frameworks. I am always looking for opportunities to learn more about the field and the future of technology. I have worked on several real life projects as well as my personal projects such as this website. you can see some of the examples down below:


## How I built this website

This is my extremely minimalistic static site hosted on github.io.
Countless of new Javascript frameworks are being made everyday, but they are all designed for extremely large traffic, and it doesn't make sense to use them on a personal blog site.
That's why I chose the opposite for my website.
I chose Hugo for static site generation, Bootstrap and SCSS for styling(vanilla CSS is pure pain), and a little bit of vanilla JS or petite-vue for some reactivity and animations.
I also plan to use Firebase or other similar alternatives to store data in case I need it later on to store comments and stuff.
The site is also automatically deployed through Github Actions.


Text me up if you like my work! I'm always free to talk(mostly). You can find me through my Email and Discord.
